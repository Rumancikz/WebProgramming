        <p>
        This is a game called Ozaria, your journey begins where you create your character and learn the fundamentals of
        coding. This game will give you a basic understanding of how coding is done. This game does not have a specific language, but is 
        to demonstate the basics of coding. You will control your character through code to create a legend. I think that this is a good game because
        you will learn and understand concepts such as  sequences, loops, debugging, and decomposition.
        In the end, you'll design a playable game that you can share with your friends!
